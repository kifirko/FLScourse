            Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at
            Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly-listed shares and control 56%
            of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public
            offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc..
            Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and
            interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became
            the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[11]

            The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond
            Google's core search engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google
            Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar),
            cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google Duo, Google Chat, and Google Meet),
            language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street
            View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking
            (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the

            lightweight, proprietary operating system based on the free and open-source Chromium OS operating system).
            Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics
            manufacturers in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in
            2016, including the Google Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless
